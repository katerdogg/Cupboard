# Cupboard

## Introduction
Author: Katie Dover 

Cupboard is a undeployed site created as my final capstone project to complete my PDX Code Guild bootcamp. I had a difficult
time coming up with an idea that would fit within the scope of the capstone project. I came across this idea on a web forum
somewhere asking developers to create ideas from non-developers. I thought it was a fantastic idea and ran with it! 

### What is Cupboard? 

Have you ever wondered what you were going to do with the expiring foods in your cupboards? Perhaps you bought a strange
ingredient for a recipe you made and never used it again? Whatever the case, Cupboard takes a list of ingredients you give it
and returns up to 50 recipes that match those ingredients! Using Yummly's API, the recipes come from dozens of the most 
popular recipe sites on the internet. With an intuitive, sleek design and quick results, this is a great site to keep on hand!

## How I Built Cupboard

Using the Django framework, I used a Python back-end with a responsive HTML, CSS, and Java Script front-end. I was granted a free 6 month
pass to Yummly's API. Much of the time I spent creating Cupboard was understanding and implementing Yummly's API to access
the recipes using API calls. 

I used Java Script to implement parallax scrolling on the front page, and used original CSS to design the rest of the site,
including the result page with a self-populating grid presenting up to 50 recipe results.

## How Do I Get Cupboard?

Cupboard is, as of now, unavailable to users. As mentioned above, I was granted a free pass to
Yummly's API. The pass is only good for six months, and if I were to deploy Cupboard, the API would be a minimum of $5k a month
just to have access to. Unless I wanted to move foward with the project and flesh it out to a fully-functioning website with
investors and a partner or two, I can not, mostly due to financial restrictions, deploy Cupboard.
